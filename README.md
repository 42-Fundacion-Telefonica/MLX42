# MLX42

Project still WIP!

My own recreation of the MiniLibX library used by 42, using glfw &amp; glad, running on OpenGL 3.3.
The goal of MLX42 is to replace the outdated and stale MiniLibX library.

## Installation

For MacOS:
- Should be straight forward with a simple `make` in the terminal.

The systems below have not been tested yet.

For Linux:
- Make sure you have installed glfw, you need to compile it from source.

For Windows:
- Switch to MacOS or Linux, as there is no CMake or way to compile for it yet.
