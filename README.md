# MLX42

Project still WIP!

My own recreation of the MiniLibX library used by 42, using OpenGL &amp; GLAD.

## Installation

For MacOS:
- Should be straight forward with a simple `make` in the terminal.

For Linux:
- Make sure you have installed glfw.

For Windows:
- Switch to MacOS or Linux (for now)
