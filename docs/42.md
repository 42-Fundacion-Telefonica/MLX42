    <h1>Welcome to the MLX42, 42Campus documentation</h1>
</div>

# Foreword
If you're considering to allow the usage of MLX42 in your campus and are wondering why you should do it, how should it work and what it will take to get it working, then this is the right spot!

MLX42 has been battle tested multiple times in hackathons other campuses and has had over 500+ commits since 2021. All students share the same sentiment, they actually enjoy using the library yet do not find it too easy to finish the projects. During that time plenty of bugs, leaks and segfaults have been ironed out.

It tackles one of the main problems that even tho 42 is a tech school they do not provided them with well maintained tools to improve their education. All a campus wants is simply the best they can give for their students.

# Technical comparison
## MiniLibX
The miniLibX is riddled with problems that have been lingering around for almost +10 years:
- `Non-maintained`: The library is practically dead, it is unclear who is there to fix the bugs and hasn't had any changes for a long time. Student pull requests on github for the X11 version go unnoticed and issues are being ignored.

- `Poor documentation`: It's documentation are a few `man` pages that are outdated and a online documentation by another student. Its understandable that students need to learn on their own, however this is a library with an extensive API. Some sort of proper documentation is simply a must for anyone to start understanding any it.

- `Poor execution`: There are multiple versions: `opengl`, `swift` & `X11`. Instead of becoming better each new iteration they just stay the same with no real improvement. It needs to should be future proof and not be dependent on a specific platform.

- `Non-Crossplatform`: Students constantly encounter the same problem, in school they work with MacOS at home they use Linux. Or they write their project on Linux but want to show it to their parents using Windows or MacOS. At each point the miniLibX fails to fill that gap. If anything the Pandemic in 2019 really showed how much students struggled with evaluating each other using the different machines and versions.

## MLX42

The main goal of MLX42 is to counter all these short comings of the original versions. There are some differences however. Mainly in the way images are rendered, regarding everything else its basically identical.

So far it all the drawbacks of miniLibX have been taken care of and students are very much enjoying the usage of it!

### Rendering

One of the biggest differences between the two libraries is the way of how rendering is taken care of.

In `miniLibX`: Students change the buffer of an image and then push it to the window.

In `MLX42`: Students put the image to the window and can change the buffer at any point in time which results in an immediate update to the image.

MLX42 uses the concept of instances instead. An image is like the original painting while instances are individual copies of this painting on the window.

There is no window clearing function because students need to learn how to properly managed their images in the first place.
They can still delete images and toggle the instances on/off of course.

Internally it uses batched rendering to further improve the rendering performance. There is a lot more detail in the actual documentation as well as inspecting the code itself.

### Maintained & Open-source

The main goal of MLX42 is to give the ability of maintaing and fixing bugs into the hands of students and pedagos and to no longer just leave their complaints unnoticed. Along with being actually open source students can just explore the code and issue PR's etc.

### Documentation
The repository comes with an actually used [Wiki](https://github.com/codam-coding-college/MLX42/wiki) as well as documentation via `markdown` in the root of the repository.

### Build system

MLX42 started using `make` however it made things really inflexible and even caused some weird bugs for others. Instead now it uses `cmake` for a truly cross-platform build system.

CMake is not a big problem for the students to face, they don't even require to understand its usage. The instructions on building the library are simply given to them as they are just 2 shell commands and thats all that is necessary.

### XPM42
Just for historical reasons I included my own file format that mimicks the XPM3 format. The way XPM's were used in the miniLibX made no sense because the way the files were supposed to handled is by compiling them into the binary itself. Instead in miniLibX it parses the files and pastes the data into memory.

Within the `tools` folder there is a python script that converts an XPM3 to XPM42.
XPM42 is not required but available as an alternative, it is highly encouraged to instead use the PNG importer, which does not leak, and instead uses `lodepng` to handle all the parsing.

---

### How can I migrate? What is necessary to change?

Migrating to MLX42 is easy and requires minimal effort, it just has 2 dependencies in order to work.

#### Dependencies
- [CMake: >= 3.18.0](https://cmake.org/download/)
- [GLFW: >= 3.3.6](https://github.com/glfw/glfw)

Other then that it is up to your pedago + sysadmin to determine how it is handed out to students.
The options are:

`A`: Have installed in the machine itself e.g: `/usr/local/lib` and use `-lmlx42` in order to link it.

`B`: Let the students clone it, preferably as a submodule, and have it be part of their repository.

There is really not much else to be done besides these steps. It's basically a drag'n'drop replacement and campuses have a choice how its handed out.

## F.A.Q

Q: **_"It has too many features! I think students should do some of them themselves..."_**

A: I can agree that there may be some features that do too much for the students.
however this can simply be fixed by just banning the usage of these functions or removing them from the library.

Eitherway the majority of additional functions are just GLFW wrappers to be able to customize the window much more extensively. E.g; Cursors, Executable Icon, ...

Students can just ignore them and for those who want them they are availble, it does not impede on their learning.

---

Q: **_"The `mlx_put_pixel` works too well..."_**

A: Rather than purposefully sabotaging the library to get a point across I deemed it necessary that library just simply works.
By default this function is already banned by all subjects. And the main idea was to force students to use images instead.

In MLX42, it always starts with an image and students are forced to face images no matter what. They still face the same learning curve
of how to actually modify the buffer of an image and learn the concept of bitshifting one way or the other.

Our proposal for this is to allow its use in the first 3 graphics projects (fract-ol, fdf, so_long).
Then later on ban it for the remaining ones (Cub3D, MiniRT). That way they can become familiar with it but
then need to explore its workings.

---

Q: **_"Are the libraries 1:1 identical?"_**

A: No, there are 100% breaking changes and for students changing from miniLibX to MLX42 will not just be a simple drag'n'drop replacement. That was also not the idea, because otherwise it would be impossible to fix some of the problems present in miniLibX.

My suggestion is to tell students who are using miniLibX to keep using it to finish their project and for new students to prefer the new one or until they reach the next graphical project.

---

Q: **_"With regards to how the rendering is done, won't that make it too easy for students?"_**

A: After almost a year in usage, from both new students who didn't use the old one and students who used both. They managed just fine and even appreciated this change as to how the rendering works in MLX42.

It is not taking away from the learning experience, its rather just shifting a function call from one place to another.
Students still find it challenging to finish the actual project itself. They still need to be faced of learning a whole new library and still need to learn how it operates.

---

Q: **_"OpenGL? Isn't that a bit old by now?"_**

A: Is OpenGL old? Sure. But in the end students simply do not care. You could argue that it is less future proof and that, Vulkan for example, should be used instead. Well, ask yourself this.

Does one need a artillery cannon to hunt for a rabbit in a forest?
If your answer is no then why does need Vulkan to render a bunch of quads on a window?

OpenGL is very easy to learn, in fact, one could argue it is actually useful for students who are interested into getting into graphics. Eitherway if one day Vulkan is required, one can create a branch and a PR which then can be merged!

Just a small reminder that it takes roughly [700+ lines of code](https://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan/blob/master/examples/triangle/triangle.cpp) to render a triangle with vulkan...

Here is the equivalent in [OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/code_viewer_gh.php?code=src/1.getting_started/2.1.hello_triangle/hello_triangle.cpp).

---

Q: **_"CMake? Won't that confuse them?"_**

A: It is 2 simple commands that are described in the README.
