If you're considering to allow the usage of MLX42 in your campus and are wondering why you should do it, how should it work and what it will take to get it working, then this is the right spot!

MLX42 has been battle tested multiple times in Hackathons other campuses and has had over 500+ commits since 2021. All students share the same sentiment, they actually enjoy using the library yet do not find it too easy to finish the projects.

How can we "migrate" to MLX42? What are the necessary steps does one need to change subjects ?
